   - Type `python --version` and press `Enter` to verify the installation.

## Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. **Update Package List:**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```

2. **Install Python:**
   - Run the following command to install Python 3:
     ```bash

     ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Type `python3 --version` in the terminal to verify the installation.

## macOS

   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```

# Virtual Environment Installation

A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated environments for them. This is particularly useful when you have projects that rely on different versions of the same package.


### 1. Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt

- On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.
- On macOS and Linux, you can use Terminal.

### 2. Create a Directory for Your Project

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and create a new directory for it.

```sh
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
```

### 3. reate a Virtual Environment
Use the venv module to create a virtual environment. Replace myenv with the name you want for your virtual environment.

```sh
python -m venv myenv
```

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:

```sh
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:

```sh
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Verify the Virtual Environment is Active
Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to show the name of the virtual environment. For example:

```sh
(myenv) user@hostname:~/my_project$
```

### 6. Install Packages in the Virtual Environment
You can now install packages using pip without affecting the global Python installation.

```sh
pip install <package_name>
```
### 7. Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by simply running:

```sh
deactivate
```
